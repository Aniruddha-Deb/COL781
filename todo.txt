1. Set CPU thread affinity - can't do, tricky on MacOS.
2. Sleep and wake threads before cpu rendering - done. start/stop methods 
   for thread creation
3. Integrate rasterizer into sw.cpp
  - run vs and fs


pass all transformed vertices to the renderthreadpool.
? Can I make the threadpool function-oriented? Won't need to maintain a class 
and pass all this stuff around then.
